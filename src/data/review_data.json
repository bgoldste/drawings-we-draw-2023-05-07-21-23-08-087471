They are PROFESSIONAL grade, which means they are legit enough for serious artists to use. But don't worry, they are also great for anyone who likes to play around with colors in coloring books or even just doodling. \n\nOne thing that sets these pencils apart is that they are oil-based, which means they have a soft, creamy texture.

Just test out each color before you use it and you'll be fine. \n\nOverall, I'd say the cyper top 72 Colored Pencils Oil-Based Set is a great option for anyone who loves to color or draw.

Or perhaps you're a parent who wants to keep your kiddos entertained with some colorful drawing action? Whatever your situation may be, the Color Pencils and Fine Tip Markers Set is ready to add some pop to your palette.\n\nLet's start with the good stuff. This set includes 12 colored pencils that are perfect for adults who love to color intricate designs and patterns. The colors are bright and vibrant, and the pencils are easy to sharpen and use. On the other hand, the 8 fine tip markers are great for kids who want to dabble in drawing and coloring. The tips are small enough to handle tiny details, but not too small that they become frustrating to use. Oh, and did we mention that the set comes with a cute pouch to store all your pencils and markers in? That means no more digging through your messy drawers to find the color you need!\n\nNow, let's tackle the cons. While the pencils and markers are great quality, there aren't many color options to choose from. Sure, you could mix and match to create new shades, but sometimes you just want that one specific hue that's missing from the set.

They got a smooth grip and a good weight to 'em, so you can write for hours without getting cramps (unless you're writing a novel, in which case, get a life). The black ink is also baller, cuz it's medium point and 1.0 mm, so you can see your words without needing a magnifying glass. \n\nNow, if you're a doodler like me, you'll love these pens for journaling. The pastel colors are pretty AF and add a touch of sweetness to your creations. You can draw unicorns, flowers, or even your ex's face (cuz you still got feelings, duh). And if you're in a boring meeting and need to spice things up, just whip out one of these bad boys and start drawing memes. Everyone will be like, \"Whoa, this person is so cool and funny, let's promote them to CEO!\" \n\nOf course, no product is perfect, so here's my pro con list:\n\nPros:\n- Comfy grip and smooth writing experience\n- Pretty pastel colors for journaling and drawing\n- Affordable price for a pack of 12 pens\n- Retractable design makes it easy to store and carry around\n- Black ink is baller and medium point\n\nCons: \n- Some of the colors may be too light for some people's liking\n- The ink may smudge if you're left-handed or writing on glossy paper\n\nOverall, I gotta say WY WENYUAN 12Pcs Ballpoint Pens are a solid purchase for anyone who wants to add some fun to their writing game. They're great for journaling, doodling, or just writing boring memos. Plus, they make a dope gift for your artsy friends who love pastels. I give these pens an 8.5 outta 10, cuz they're not perfect, but they're pretty darn close. Get 'em before they're gone, fam!",
